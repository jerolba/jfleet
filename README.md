# JFleet

JFleet is a Java library which persist in database large collections of Java POJOs as fast as possible, using the best available technique in each database provider, achieving it with alternate persistence methods from each JDBC driver implementation.

Its goal is to store a large amount of information in a **single table** using available batch persistence techniques.

despite being able to use JPA annotations to map Java objects to tables and columns, **JFleet is not an ORM**.

## Supported databases

Each database provides some technique to insert a bulk of information bypassing standard JDBC commands, but accessible from Java:
 - **MySQL** : Using the [LOAD DATA](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/load-data.html) statement. 
 - **PostgreSQL**: Using the [COPY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/sql-copy.html) command.

In both cases, and in unsupported databases, you can use the default implementation based on the standard [JDBC executeBatch](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html#executeBatch--) statement.

## Benchmark 

**JFleet performance is comparable to using the native database import tool, and is between 2.1X and 3.8X faster than using the JDBC driver directly.**

## Usage

JFleet needs to know how to map your Java objects or entities to a table. JFleet provides two mechanisms to map your objects to a table:

- Using standard [JPA annotations](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/package-summary.html) like [@Entity](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/Entity.html), [@Column](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/Column.html) or [@ManyToOne](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/ManyToOne.html). 
- Mapping manually each column to one object field or with a `Function`   

### Using standard JPA annotations 

Using the usual JPA annotations, JFleet extract their information and creates a map between fields and columns:

```java

import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
@Table(name = "customer_contact")
public class Customer {

    private Long id;

    private String contactName;
    
    @Column(name="customer_name")
    private String name;
    
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "city_id")
    private City city;
    
    @Temporal(TemporalType.DATE)
    private Date birthDate;
    
    //Getters and setters
}

@Entity
@Table(name = "city")
public class City {
    
    @Id
    private Integer id;
    
    private String name;
    
    //Getters and setters
}

```

Like JPA, JFleet follows the convention of using the field name if no `@Column` name is provided, or the class name if no `@Table` name is provided. 

Given a collection of objects Customer to persist in MySQL with the Load Data technique, you only need to provide a JDBC Connection:


```java
    try (Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection()){
        Collection<Customer> customers = buildLargeAmountOfCustomers();
        BulkInsert<Customer> bulkInsert = new LoadDataBulkInsert<>(Customer.class);
        bulkInsert.insertAll(connection, customers);
    }
```

If you are using PostgreSQL the `BulkInsert` implementation is `PgCopyBulkInsert`. 
JFleet prefers Streams to Collections because it does not force you to instantiate all objects in memory, and allows you to create them lazily in some stream process: 

```java
    try (Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection()){
        Stream<Customer> customers = createLongStreamOfCustomers();
        BulkInsert<Customer> bulkInsert = new PgCopyBulkInsert<>(Customer.class);
        bulkInsert.insertAll(connection, customers);
    }
```

More information about supported annotations and limitations can be found in the project [wiki page](https://github.com/jerolba/jfleet/wiki/Supported-JPA-annotations)

### Maping manually each column
 
If you have any problem using JPA annotations in your domain objects or directly you don't want to add `javax.persistence` dependency to your project, you can configure it manually mapping each column to a field path, separating each field name in the path with `.`. 

This mechanism is much more powerfull than JPA, and allows you also to map values that are not present in the object, transform or systhetice it.    

Given a similar domain object, we need to persist the customer age, and the object only have the country name, but not the code:

```java

public class Customer {

    private Long id;
    private String contactName;
    private String name;
    private City city;
    private String countryName;
    private Date birthDate;
    
    //Getters and setters
}

```

You configure JFleet with the mapping info:

```java

Date today = new Date();

EntityInfo customerMap = new EntityInfoBuilder(Customer.class, "customer_contact")
	.addField("id", "id")
	.addField("contactName", "contactname")
	.addField("name", "customer_name")
	.addField("city_id", "city.id")
	.addColumn("country_id", STRING, customer -> mapCountryName2CountryId.get(customer.getCountryName()))
	.addColumn("age", INT, custormer -> calculateDifferenceYears(customer.getBirthDate(), today));
	.build();
```

And instead of instantiate the BulkInsert with the annotated class, we use the created EntityInfo:

```java
    try (Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection()){
        Collection<Customer> customers = buildLargeAmountOfCustomers();
        BulkInsert<Customer> bulkInsert = new LoadDataBulkInsert<>(customerMap);
        bulkInsert.insertAll(connection, customers);
    }
```

You can find more examples on how to map objects in the [example project](https://github.com/jerolba/jfleet/tree/master/jfleet-samples/src/main/java/org/jfleet/samples).


In all cases transactionality, batch size or error management can be configured. You can find more information in the project [wiki page](https://github.com/jerolba/jfleet/wiki/BulkInsert-configuration).

## Dependency

JFleet is uploaded to Maven Central Repository and to use it, you need to add the following Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jfleet</groupId>
    <artifactId>jfleet</artifactId>
    <version>0.6.1</version>
</dependency>
```

or download the single [jar](http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/jfleet/jfleet/0.6.1/jfleet-0.6.1.jar) from Maven repository.

You can always find the latest published version in the [MvnRepository searcher](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jfleet/jfleet).

By default JFleet uses basic `javax.persistence` annotations. If you use it, and you don't have any JPA implementation as a dependency in your project, you must add the Javax Persistence API dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.persistence</groupId>
    <artifactId>persistence-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```
Apart from `persistence-api` and [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/) for logging, JFleet does not have any dependency.
JFleet has not been tested against all JDBC driver versions, but it is expected that any modern version will work properly.


### Supported database versions

JFleet is configured to execute continuous integration tests against [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/jerolba/jfleet) service, using the latest stable release of **MySQL 5.7** and the latest stable release of **PostgreSQL 10.6**.

MySQL 8 is not yet supported by JFleet because requires the latest JDBC driver which it is completely rewritten, and all internal classes used by JFleet change from 5.x versions.

**JFleet is currently running in production against AWS Aurora MySQL edition**, and has been tested for benchmarks with the Google Cloud managed versions of MySQL and Postgres.   

Any database engine with a standard JDBC driver should be used with the `JdbcBulkInsert` implementation.

## Running the tests

Tests need a MySQL and a PostgreSQL instances running in localhost. A database called `testdb` must exist and an user `test` with password `test` must have `CREATE TABLE` and `DROP TABLE` permissions.

You can modify this settings changing locally [mysql-test.properties](https://github.com/jerolba/jfleet/blob/master/jfleet-core/src/test/resources/mysql-test.properties) and [postgres-test.properties](https://github.com/jerolba/jfleet/blob/master/jfleet-core/src/test/resources/postgres-test.properties) files.

To execute all test you must execute the command:

```bash
$ .\gradlew test
```

You can also fork the project and test it in your [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/signup/) free account.
